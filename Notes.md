# speedo: Code for Arduino and Python based Bicycle Speedometer

## Vision
Create a system that displays the speed of a bicycle using a home 
built magnetic revolution sensor on a bicycle wheel, converting analog
to digital using an Arduino, passing that data via USB to a Android
handset to be displayed using qpython.

## Status(2016-07-03)
Defined project. 


## Things to do
- Resurect the arduino code that reads from the revolution
sensor
- Describe in project archive how the system is put together
including how the revolution sensor was built.
- Figure out how to read USB from python on android.
- Figure out how to display speed data from python on android.
- Add a license to the project
- Add a .gitignore to the project.
