# speedo: Code for Arduino and Python based Bicycle Speedometer

## Vision
Create a system that displays the speed of a bicycle using a home 
built magnetic revolutionsensor on a bicycle wheel, converting analog
to digital using an Arduino, passing that data via USB to a Android
handset to be displayed using qpython.
